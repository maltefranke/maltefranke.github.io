I'm an incoming PhD student in Machine Learning at ETH Zürich advised by Andreas Krause and Kjell Jorner. 
I will also be affiliated with the European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems (ELLIS) as a PhD fellow, co-advised by José Miguel Hernández-Lobato at the University of Cambridge. 
In my research, I will develop new generative machine learning methods for chemical discovery.

Prior to joining ETH Zürich, I have interned with Dunia working on ML for integrated electrocatalyst discovery. 
During my studies at RWTH Aachen, I have worked with Alexander Mitsos on numerical optimization for chemical inverse design. 
I have also done an ERASMUS stay at EPFL, working with Clemence Corminboeuf and Philippe Schwaller on reaction prediction.
In my Master's thesis at MIT with Rafael Gómez-Bombarelli I developed a flow matching model for multi-molecule docking in porous materials. 

Reach out if you are interested in working with me!
